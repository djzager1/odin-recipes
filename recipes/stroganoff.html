    <h1>Chef John's Classic Beef Stroganoff</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This classic beef stroganoff recipe is a fairly lean version, as most recipes call for more cream.
        <p>This is something you can easily adjust to your tastes. I like a little thicker version,</p>
        <P>with just enough sauce to coat the meat. Serve over buttered noodles.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast, cut into 1/2-inch thick strips</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
                <li>1/2 medium onion, sliced or diced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
                <li>2 cups beef broth, divided</li>
                <li>3/4 cup creme fraiche</li>
                <li>1 tablespool fresh chopped chives</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Season beef generously with salt and pepper.</li> 
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until nearly smoking. Stir in beef; cook, stirring constantly, for 6 to 7 minutes, until liquid evaporates and meat browns.</li>
                <li>Remove meat from the pan and set aside. Stir mushrooms, onions, and butter into the pan; cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables are lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in flour; cook for 1 to 2 minutes until incorporated. Stir in wine and 1 cup of broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return beef to the pan. Stir in remaining cup of broth; bring to a simmer and cook on low heat for about 1 hour, covered, until beef is tender and sauce is thick. Stir every 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in creme fraiche. Stir in chives. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
